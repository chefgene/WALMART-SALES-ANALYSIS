## ANALYSIS
## which state has the highest profit and sales and what is the highes count of sales by category?

CALIFONIA took the lead among the top 5 states with the highest profit, with a profit of 78k, it sales came mostly from the sales of phones and storage but the sum of it profit was from binders and paper with the highest count by orders. followed by WASHINGTON  whose most of it sales and profit came from binders and storage. invariably these were the two states we had more sales among the top 5 states .but we incurred more losses in COLORADO from the sales of most phones and storage to the tune of 7k,  3k in ARIZONA, and 1k in OREGON.

more sales of phones were carried out in California, same was observed among the rest of the products by category

## which state the highest count of sales and which prduct has the highest profit and count of sales?

Our count of sales was the highest among paper and binders and this was seen in California, this shouldn't be surprising because the state of  California has the highest population, and not only that it also boasts the highest GDP in the United State. we saw that Oregon and Colorado have the lowest count of sales.
the product by category with the highest profit was binders and paper. both having California as their destination place among the top 5 states. while binder and paper have the highest count by order.

## which year and month has the highest sales and profit?

2011 started on a good note but profit dropped in the month of February and picked up in the month of March and reached it highest in August. then we saw a slight decrease throughout the year of 2011. 2012 maintained the tempo of 2011 but we saw a sharp decline in the profit in March and a sudden rise from April to September,

which marked the highest in the year 2012 then we saw a decrease till December. we saw the same trend in 2013 except that in December of 2013, we had a sharp loss

to the tune of &1.1k .2014 started with a huge surprise giving us the highest profit so far in the past 3 years.

sales started well in 2011 and shoot up till December until it started to decline that same month and this continued till April 2012 until we saw a surge till December 2012.
dales spike reduced greatly in it momentum till February 2013 we saw a sharp increase in sales too which was steady and gave us one of the best with good sales among the four years
